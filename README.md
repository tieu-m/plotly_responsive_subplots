Responsive subplots for plotly

Requires plotly and numpy:
```pip install plotly numpy```

Plots a subplot with subplot 1 containing a grid of points and subplot 2 reacting when a point is clicked.

Launch with
```python create_figure.py```

The script compares the time spent when using plotly objects with when using dictionaries. Both do the same figure, so you may want to comment one of them before running the script
